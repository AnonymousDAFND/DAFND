# Illustration of The Retrieval Process through Google Search Engine



This figure illustrates an example of retrieving additional information using the Google Search Engine via SerpAPI, and presenting the top-1 retrieved result as an evidence snippet (highlighted in the red box in the figure). The snippets include answer boxes and tables. We prepend the page title to the beginning of each snippet.

In simple terms, the content of the snippet in the figure below represents the retrieved information. This search strategy is proposed in [1].
